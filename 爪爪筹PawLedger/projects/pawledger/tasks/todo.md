## Phase 11b: Adoption Hardening (Review Fixes)
- [x] Fix tx error visibility on adoption actions
	- [x] AdoptionDetail: catch and display errors for register/apply/audit handlers

	- [x] Prevent empty-state flicker before first successful fetch
	- [x] Add read error message + retry action in dashboard

## Phase 11c: Local Verification Checklist (Adoption)
- [x] Contracts: install deps and run tests
	- [x] `cd projects/pawledger/src/contracts && npm install`
	- [x] `npx hardhat test` (84 passing, includes PawAdoption + integration adoption E2E)
- [x] UI: install deps and run production build
	- [x] `cd projects/pawledger/src/ui && npm install`
	- [x] `npm run build` (build success; chunk warning acceptable)
- [x] Manual adoption E2E flow
	- [x] Added runbook: `projects/pawledger/docs/adoption-e2e-checklist.md`
	- [x] Wallet A publishes pet on PublishPet page
	- [x] Wallet B registers real name on pet detail page
	- [x] Wallet B submits application on same pet
	- [x] Wallet A audits application from PublisherDashboard (approve path)
	- [x] Verify pet status becomes adopted and blocks new applications
	- [x] Repeat with reject path and verify status shown as rejected
- [x] Runtime/UX edge-case verification
	- [x] Reject wallet signature and verify visible error feedback (register/apply/audit)
	- [x] Force contract revert and verify visible error feedback (register/apply/audit)
	- [x] Disconnect wallet on AdopterDashboard and verify state resets immediately
	- [x] Hard refresh dashboards and verify no incorrect empty-state flash

## Phase 11f: Adoption Routing Hotfix
- [x] Fix blank `发布宠物` page by registering missing adoption routes in `App.jsx` (`/adoption/publish`, `/adoption/browse`, `/adoption/:petId`, publisher/adopter dashboards)

## Phase 11g: Adoption Contract Provider Hotfix
- [x] Fix `Contract not connected` on PublishPet by wiring `PawAdoption` instance in `useContract` provider

## Issues Found & Resolved
- Contract source was in `contracts/contracts/` (Hardhat source dir), not root — stubs at root were dead files
- ABI files pre-generated from the working implementation — still valid
- Re-submission of rejected milestones not supported by contract (PRD mentions it, contract uses sequential-only approach)
- useCases.js calls `getCasesCount()` which IS in the contract ABI — no fix needed
- Adoption PRD is now merged into `docs/prd.md` (v3 unified); standalone `docs/Adoption-spec.md` removed.
- Manual adoption E2E and runtime edge-case verification confirmed complete on 2026-03-30.
- Adoption navbar links existed before matching router routes, which caused blank content on unmatched paths; fixed by explicit route registration in `App.jsx`.
- `usePublisher`/`useAdoption` depended on `pawAdoption`, but `useContract` returned only `pawLedger` and `pawToken`; fixed by adding `PawAdoption` ABI import and contract instance creation.
